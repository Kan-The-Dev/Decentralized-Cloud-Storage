# Decentralized Cloud Storage

A decentralized cloud storage service powered by Ethereum and IPFS. This system allows users to securely upload, share, and manage files while paying for storage using smart contracts.

---

## **Features**

- **File Uploading**: Upload files to IPFS and store their hashes on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **File Sharing**: Share files with others by sharing the IPFS hash and interacting with the smart contract.
- **Storage Payment**: Users can pay for file storage through Ethereum transactions.
- **Decentralized**: Fully decentralized, ensuring no central authority controls the storage.
- **Ethereum Smart Contracts**: The contract handles file metadata, ownership, and payment for storage.
- **IPFS Integration**: Store files off-chain using the IPFS network.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Solidity**: Smart contracts for decentralized file storage and sharing.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized file storage protocol.
- **Ethereum**: Blockchain for file metadata and payment processing.
- **Node.js**: Backend server for managing requests and interacting with the blockchain.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads.
- **Infura**: A service that connects the application to the Ethereum network.
- **IPFS HTTP Client**: Used for interacting with the IPFS network.
